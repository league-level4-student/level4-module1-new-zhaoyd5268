/*
 * An interface could be considered a class that is completely abstract. Like an 
 * abstract class it can contain abstract methods, but cannot contain member 
 * variables(with one exception) or implemented methods.
 * 
 * They are most useful when you have groups of methods that are useful for 
 * providing a common functionality to other classes.
 * 
 * The interfaces you have worked with the most so far have been the Listener
 * series for Swing components e.g. ActionListener, KeyListener, MouseListener.
 * 
 * Unlike classes(and by extension abstract classes) classes can implement
 * more than one interface at a time.
